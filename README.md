Hello there!
Welcome to this project that was creatively implemented using what was available in the Android ecosystem.
It is a replica of the famous game of checkers. Since it is something that requires two to play, it was made such that two can play it.
The technologies used were as follows:
	a. Database-Cloud Firestore
 		i. This stored player information as well as in-game session moves
		ii. Database Transactions were utilised to ensure moves are correct.
 	b. UI-Android Recyclerview(Grid version)
To download it, here is the link to the APK: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-hWvbYd8XOT2migYRpn76GC7Nhv6BHf-/view?usp=drive_link
